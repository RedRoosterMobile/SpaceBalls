Have the Synthwave thing shader in the background on a plane
adjust the field of view
make tile change color with music
and other music stuff already build in

make enemies go down in a line, but have some z movement in there as offset
jitter, swaps, whatever
make a map of the movements, build an editor? string based? matrix?

FIX camera

add the same game, adjust the fov to match
